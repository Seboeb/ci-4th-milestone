# Tasting Experience - Development
This project is build for users of the [The Tasting Experience Finder](https://github.com/Seboeb/ci-2nd-milestone) app and [The Tasting Experience Recipes](https://github.com/Seboeb/ci-3rd-milestone) community website. Since these projects are new and still under development, there is a high probability that some bugs are present. This project provides a platform where users can submit bugs that they have found and keep track of reported issues (also from other users). The cool thing is, that not only bugs can be reported but new feature requests as well!

At [this](https://the-tasting-experience-dev.herokuapp.com/) website you can see all reported bugs and feature requests and start adding new ones of yourself.

## UX
This project has a mobile first approach. The website must provide a clear landing page where the users get a first impression of the goal of this website. Users must be able to subscribe and, subsequently, create an account. Bug reports and feature requests can be found via the navigation bar. After logging in users are able to create bug reports and feature request. User must be able to see a clear overview of all the issues and, where possible, see graphs of the development progress.
